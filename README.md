# R-code-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-on-Crown-Prosecution-Service-Case-Outcomes-
The dataset utilized for this assessment project spans from April 2016 to March 2018, totaling 24 months. It comprises the Principal Offence Category dataset from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), providing insights into the primary offense categories involved in CPS-handled criminal cases. 


The objectives of this report are to:

•	Conduct a descriptive analysis of the Principal Offense Category dataset from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), spanning April 2016 to March 2018, to understand the nature and distribution of criminal offenses prosecuted by the CPS.

•	Descriptive analysis of monthly outcomes of CPS including summary statistics and visualization of trends. Explore crime trends and patterns within principal offense categories to identify significant patterns and variations over the 24-month period.

•	Analyze prosecutorial outcomes, including convictions and unsuccessful outcomes, to assess the effectiveness of the legal process and identify factors influencing case outcomes.

•	Investigate correlations between principal offense categories, outcomes, and other relevant variables to uncover potential relationships and insights.

•	Develop and evaluate prediction models, including linear regression, clustering, and classification techniques, to forecast future trends and outcomes based on historical data.
